# Sandcastle
EGD Sandcastle game

Sandbox Sandbox was created as one of my games for my Experimental Game Design class. Our group was tasked with answering the question “Why do we play games?”

We all agreed that one main reason of why we play games was to share them with our friends and family, even those who don’t usually play games. We decided to create a game that would be accessible to everyone, while having cooperative elements so that gamers and non-gamers alike could have fun together.

Sandbox Sandbox is a sand castle building sandbox game. Up to four players can build, decorate, and destroy sandcastles in this open world. Scattered around the world are sandcastle buckets, seashells, bubble guns, and more. 

In this project, I designed and programmed the underlying data structure to keep track of types of castle blocks and their locations. I developed a saving and loading system for the game so that players can save their creations, as well. We used scriptable objects for each of the sandcastle blocks to simplify the rules for what can be placed where and to simplify how the world is loaded.
